# FiveM_NoMoreStuntJumps
Removing a lot of stunts and normal jumps on the GTA V map. <br />

I was tired of seing jumps all over the map, so I decided to remove a lot of "stunts" and a few "normal" jumps. <br />

**Credits :** <br/>
I based myself on [MapFixes](https://github.com/TayMcKenzieNZ/MapFixes/) resource made by [TayMcKenzieNZ](https://github.com/taymckenzienz) and [LUKY00010](https://forum.cfx.re/u/luky00010/), so thanks to them !

**Known bugs :** <br/>
Collisions are still here on #24 stunt jump, if anyone knows how I can remove them it will be very helpful. I tried to delete/remove them but it's just still here in game and I don't know why.
