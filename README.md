# FiveM - No More Stunt Jumps
Removing a lot of stunts and normal jumps on the GTA V map. <br />

I was tired of seing jumps all over the map, so I decided to remove a lot of "stunts" and a few "normal" jumps. <br />

**Patchnote 1.1 :** <br/>
- Fixed collision bugs on stunt jump #24
- Removed 1 jump in "Del Perro".
- Removed 2 jumps in "Rockford Hills".
- Removed 1 jump in "Sandy Shores".
- "Update checker" added to resource

**Removed stunts, based on [this](https://gta-5-map.com/) map :** <br />
